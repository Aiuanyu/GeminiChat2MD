When updating the `@version` in `ptt-to-markdown.user.js`, be sure to also update the top-level `SCRIPT_VERSION` constant. This ensures that the `parser` version in the generated Markdown's frontmatter matches the script's version.

If an issue title contains `[Gemini]` or `[Jules]`, it indicates that the `gemini-to-markdown.user.js` script should be modified, as it handles conversations from both models.
